This is my "hello-world". ROD seemed a lot cooler. :)

I'm another one of those people who really doesn't think they have much to say about themselves. I'm here to learn to code so I can hide behind a wall of text and/or be seen through what I create. I have a lot to learn. "Poco a poco", as the saying goes.

Have a great day. :)
